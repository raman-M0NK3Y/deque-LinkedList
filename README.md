# Deque Abstratc Data Type 

Deque ADT, is a generalization of a stack and a queue that
supports inserting and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. 

In the project a Deque interface is implemented using a doubly-linked-list (DLL) with a
header and trailer as its underlying data structure. The Deque2 class can be tested by running the DeuqeTest.java class.

The way the test code works is by storing first N integers in a deque which is provided by user input. It removes integers one at a time until only one integer 
is left which is declared the winner. Insructions on how integres are removed from the list are provided in the DequeTest.java file.
